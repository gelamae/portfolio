			<h1>Hi, I'm Angela Mae D. Ducalang</h1>
			<h3>BSIT Student</h3>
			<p>I, Angela Mae D. Ducalang, was born on the 26th day of September 2000, in Dasmarinas City, Cavite. I am 22 years old. Right now I have a business as a nail tech at our house, so somehow I am making money. I am happy with what I am doing, and I hope it will grow for the future of me and my family.

In 2019, I enrolled at Cavite State University Bacoor City Campus with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology.

I have knowledge of Java, HTML, and PHP. With the help of YouTube, I have learned a lot and know that I can use them in encoding. I have no work experience related to IT yet; maybe in the future I will have experience. My most recent IT project may have been for school activities such as database PHP and so on.
